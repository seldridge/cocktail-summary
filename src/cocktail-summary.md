# Cocktail Summary

Ongoing notes about cocktails.

## Spirit Classification

### Base Spirits

1. Gin
2. Vodka
3. Tequila, Mezcal
4. Whiskey
  - American: Bourbon, Rye
  - Scotch/Irish: Delicate, Peaty

Cocktails typically have some dilution.
Because of this they benefit from higher proof, 50% ABV spirits.

Suggestions:

1. "Navy Strength" gin, e.g., [Perry Tot's Navy Strength Gin](https://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?search=26278).
2. [Evan Williams Bottle in Bond Bourbon](https://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?search=31717), [Rittenhouse 100](https://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?search=14246)

**You don't need all of these if you're interested in cocktails.**

### Other Stuff

#### Vermouth and Sherry

Vermouth is a fortified wine apertif (something you drink before dinner to stimulate the appetite).
Vermouth will tend to make a drink "richer".

Sherry (Port works, too) is a fortified wine digestif (something you drink after dinner to help you digest food).
Sherry will tend to make a drink "drier".

Most cocktails will use one of these, but one can be substituted for the other with an interesting effect on the flavor of the drink.
Hence, it's good to have one or the other.

Interesting vermouths:

1. [Cocchi Americano](https://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?search=23153)
2. [Kina L'Aero d'Or](https://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?search=28874)
3. [Carpano Antica](https://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?search=03936)
4. [Contratto Bianco](https://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?search=35170)

#### Other Apertifs/Digestifs

Amaro is a class of Italian liqueurs that can be flavored with just about anything: plants, citrus peels, nuts,

1. Campari (fruit)
2. Ramazotti
3. Averna (herbs, roots, citrus)
4. Fernet (herbs, spices, rhubarb)
5. Cynar (Artichoke)

One of these is good to have around.
I'll usually buy one, use that for cocktails, then never buy it again and switch to something else (the exception being Campari).

#### Bitters

Some cocktails will call for "bitters".
There are a lot of these.
The benefit of bitters is that you can put them in sparkling water and it tastes great.

Suggestions:

1. Fee Brothers Old Fashion Aromatic Bitters

Fun thing to do if you're in New York: there's a shop in the West Village called The Meadow that only sells chocolate, salt, and bitters.

## Simple Ratios

### ~3:1

Martini (gin:vermouth, vodka:vermouth) or Manhattan (bourbon:vermouth, rye: vermouth)

### 1:1:1

Classic example is a [Negroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroni) (gin:campari:vermouth).
This is an excellent jumping off point as you have three things to play with:

1. All base spirits: gin, vodka, tequila, mezcal, whiskey
2. All amari
1. All vermouth/sherry
